The majority of content is under 
- `/content/*` - dedicated pages
- `/data/home/*` - filler content in .yaml files

## Write a blog post

- use the correct template. See other blog posts. for a list of all available features see the `/content/blog/.blog-template.md` file. you can render it out by removing the `.` in the file name, or copy it into your blog post to see the content.
